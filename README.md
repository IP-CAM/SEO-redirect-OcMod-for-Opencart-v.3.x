# SEO Redirect

## Description
The **SEO Redirect** OpenCart extension allows to redirect requests to outdated URLs to new URLs using HTTP 301 response status code. This way, search engines will be notified that the requested resource has finally moved to a new URL, and they will update their links to the resource. Also allows to log broken (404) requests and redirect them to the search page.  
Compatible with OpenCart 3x versions.
